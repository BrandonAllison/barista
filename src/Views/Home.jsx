       <p style={{color:"black"}}> Some fight for money. Some fight for glory. Hes fighting for his sons love. Sylvester Stallone blends action with sentimentality in this family action drama as struggling trucker Lincoln Hawk who, following the death of his estranged wife, strives to rebuild his life. Although he tries to make amends with the son he left years earlier, the boy wants little to do with his father--until Lincoln enters the national arm-wrestling competition in Las Vegas. Stallone co-wrote the screenplay.
